# Explanation from paper

VEPESS dataset: the set contains visually evoked potentials from 18 subjects recorded by the
authors of Robbins et al. (2018). The measurements were done by following the oddball paradigm.
Subjects were presented with sequences of images that consisted of target and non-target types.
Based on the type of the shown image, the subjects had to push the corresponding buttons. Data
were recorded with an EEG device with 64 + 6 electrodes in the 10-20 standard configuration and
sampled at 512 Hz. In this work, we use raw measurements. Signals were band-pass filtered from
1 - 40 Hz with a zero-phase filter, and epochs were extracted between [0, 1] seconds from the onset
of the target/non-target image. The epochs were normalized by channel-wise mean subtraction and
deviation division into the range [âˆ’1., 1.].

BCI Competition IV Dataset IIa (BCIC4D2a): the set contains motor imagery signals from
9 participants. The subjects were asked to imagine the movement of their left and right hand, also
their feet and tongue, for a couple of seconds after the instruction cue were presented on their screen.
Data was recorded from 22 EEG and 3 EOG channels following the 10-20 standard system. The
measurements were sampled at 250 Hz and band-pass filtered from 0.5 - 100 Hz. Furthermore, a
notch filter at 50 Hz was applied to eliminate the line noise. We further band-pass filtered the signals
between 4 - 38 Hz with a zero-phase filter and down-sampled them to 128 Hz. Following the work
of , we extracted epochs from the recordings between [0.5, 4] seconds from the onset of the cue and
normalized them by channel-wise mean subtraction and deviation division. We excluded samples
marked as rejected due to artifacts by the publishers of the set.
